      <description>Hi! I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated my website in a while so it has been a minute. A little about myself in the past few months. I got a Pomeranian Husky puppy and he is called named &amp;ldquo;Jin&amp;rdquo;. He is definitely got my hands full but he is currently not with me at college and I could not watch him as I would have liked to.
Ever since I started attending University at Buffalo to pursue my Bachelors in Computer Science, I have met so many great individuals that support me and love me for who I am.</description>

      <description>Something that has always sparked my interest is Cryptocurrency!
Definition of Cryptocurrency from Google - a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.
In the near future, I do think that Blockchain has some very useful cases in the real world but implementation and adapation has not quite reached that level yet.</description>

      <description>Hiyo!
I am currently a 20 year old, who is attending school at University at Buffalo. On top of my academics, I&amp;rsquo;m currently an intern at the leading cloud foundry consultancy company - Stark &amp;amp; Wayne.
I am expected to graduate in 2020 with a B.S in Computer Science. I am just enjoying the ride and am using Hugo to create my website!
Some of my hobbies include: hiking, climbing, going to the gym and when I have spare time, I play League of Legends!</description>

      <title>Personal Website</title>

      <description>This is a personal project of mine as I think it is good for all potential Computer Science graduates to have a website. This allows recruiters to see what you are capable of, and it is good to keep track of all your things!
Currently, I have it hosted on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) but I have also implemented Cloud Foundry using PWS into my website that can be seen on my GitHub.</description>

      <description>While interning at Stark &amp;amp; Wayne, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a Python script that would scrape data during an event based off a website called &amp;ldquo;Sched&amp;rdquo;. After the data was scraped, the results were on a csv file. This was built using BeautifulSoup and Requests.</description>
