      <description>Something that has always sparked my interest is Cryptocurrency!
Definition of Cryptocurrency from Google - a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.
In the near future, I do think that Blockchain has some very useful cases in the real world but implementation and adapation has not quite reached that level yet.</description>

      <description>Hiyo!
I am currently a 20 year old, who is attending school at University at Buffalo. On top of my academics, I&amp;rsquo;m currently an intern at the leading cloud foundry consultancy company - Stark &amp;amp; Wayne.
I am expected to graduate in 2020 with a B.S in Computer Science. I am just enjoying the ride and am using Hugo to create my website!
Some of my hobbies include: hiking, climbing, going to the gym and when I have spare time, I play League of Legends!</description>
