    <p>Hi!
I haven&rsquo;t updated my website in a while so it has been a minute. A little about myself in the past few months. I got a Pomeranian Husky puppy and he is called named &ldquo;Jin&rdquo;. He is definitely got my hands full but he is currently not with me at college and I could not watch him as I would have liked to.</p>

<p>Ever since I started attending University at Buffalo to pursue my Bachelors in Computer Science, I have met so many great individuals that support me and love me for who I.</p>

<p>Fast forward to Spring 2019, I&rsquo;m still expanding myself more as an individual and getting to know more about my limits. There are so many great people at University that will strive you to do your best. I am so grateful for the opportunities that I was given in the past few weeks as I wouldn&rsquo;t be the same person as I was from last semester.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still currently an intern at Stark &amp; Wayne as well. My title there is currently &ldquo;Cloud Engineer Intern&rdquo;. I am currently working on the <a href="https://shieldproject.io/">Shield Project</a> there under <a href="https://github.com/jhunt">James Hunt</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to working on Shield, I was updating Stackscale for PCF. I changed versions in their European Datacenter from 2.1 to 2.4. In April,I will be attending NA Cloud Foundry Summit 2019 under Stark &amp; Wayne. See you guys there if you are attending!</p>
