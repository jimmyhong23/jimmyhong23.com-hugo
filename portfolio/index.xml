      <description>This is a personal project of mine as I think it is good for all potential Computer Science graduates to have a website. This allows recruiters to see what you are capable of, and it is good to keep track of all your things! Currently, I have it hosted on a domain but I have also implemented Cloud Foundry into my website that can be seen on my GitHub.</description>
