      <description>This is a personal project of mine as I think it is good for all potential Computer Science graduates to have a website. This allows recruiters to see what you are capable of, and it is good to keep track of all your things!
Currently, I have it hosted on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) but I have also implemented Cloud Foundry using PWS into my website that can be seen on my GitHub.</description>

      <description>While interning at Stark &amp;amp; Wayne, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a Python script that would scrape data during an event based off a website called &amp;ldquo;Sched&amp;rdquo;. After the data was scraped, the results were on a csv file. This was built using BeautifulSoup and Requests.</description>
